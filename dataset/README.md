The details of 10 high-dimensional datasets used in the paper are shown in the table below. The first six datasets ("Arrhythmia", "Gastrointestinal", "LSVT_voice_rehabilitation", "PersonGait", "SCADI", and "Urban_land_cover") are from UCI repository, and the rest("ORL", "warpAR10P", "warpPIE10P", and "Yale") are from scikit-feature repository. The 4 datasets ("CNAE9", "COIL20", "lung" and "TOX_171") are also included in this folder, which relatively have a longer runtime.
