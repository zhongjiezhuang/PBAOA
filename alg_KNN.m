%alg_KNN   K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
%   
%   TEST_PREDICT = alg_KNN(TRAIN,TRAIN_LABEL,TEST,K)
%   returns a column vector containing labels.
%   
%   K is the number of the nearest neighbors.
%   TRAIN and TRAIN_LABEL must have the same number of rows.
%   TRAIN and TEST must be matrices with the same number of columns.
%   TRAIN_LABEL must have only one column.
%   Rows represent samples.
%   Columns represent the dimensions of samples.
%   This algorithm is based on Euclidean distance.
